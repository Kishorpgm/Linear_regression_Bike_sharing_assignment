## General Information

### Problem Statement
A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. In such an attempt, BoomBikes aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19. They have planned this to prepare themselves to cater to the people's needs once the situation gets better all around and stand out from other service providers and make huge profits.

So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state. 


***The company wants to know:***

- Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
- How well those variables describe the bike demands

***Objective:***

- To develop a linear model with the available independent variables that quantitatively relates factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market.
- The model will drive the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations.
- The model will used by the management to understand and manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations.
